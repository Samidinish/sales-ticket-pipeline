# Event Ticket Sales Data Pipeline

## Project Overview

This mini project implements a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Python and MySQL.

The system simulates a ticket platform that ingests third-party ticket sales data from a CSV file, stores it in a MySQL database, and analyzes ticket sales to determine the most popular events.

This project demonstrates data loading, and aggregation queries using Python database connectors.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- MySQL
- mysql-connector-python
- CSV file processing

## What the Pipeline Does

### Step 1: Database Connection
Establishes connection to MySQL using `mysql.connector`.

### Step 2: CSV Data Loading
Reads `third_party_sales_1.csv` and inserts each record into the `sales` table.

Dates are converted into proper DATE format before insertion.

### Step 3: Data Analysis
Runs an aggregation query to determine the most popular ticket events based on total tickets sold.

- Christmas Spectacular (Total Sold: 5)
